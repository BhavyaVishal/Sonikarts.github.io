    <h2>coronavirus [covied-19] prevention 12 tips are hear????</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash your hands frequently and carefully Use warm water and soap and rub
        your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists,
        between your fingers, and under your fingernails. You can also use an
        antibacterial and antiviral soap. Use hand sanitizer when you cannot
        wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day,
        especially after touching anything including your phone or laptop.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid touching your face SARS-CoV-2 can live on hard surfaces for up to
        72 hours. You can get the virus on your hands if you touch a surface
        like a doorknob, gas pump handle, or your cell phone. Avoid touching any
        part of your face or head including your mouth, nose, and eyes. Also
        avoid biting your fingernails. This can give SARS-CoV-2 a chance to go
        from your hands into your body.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stop shaking hands and hugging people — for now Similarly, avoid
        touching other people. Skin to skin contact can pass SARS-CoV-2 from one
        person to another.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don’t share personal items Do not share personal items like phones,
        makeup, or combs. It’s also important not to share eating utensils and
        straws. Teach children to recognize their reusable cup, straw, and other
        dishes for their own use only.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze SARS-CoV-2 is found
        in high amounts in the nose and mouth. This means it can be carried by
        air droplets to other people when you cough or sneeze. It can also land
        on hard surfaces and stay there for up to 3 days. Use a tissue or sneeze
        into your elbow to keep your hands as clean as possible. Wash your hands
        carefully after you sneeze or cough, regardless.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clean and disinfect surfaces Use alcohol-based disinfectants to clean
        hard surfaces in your home like countertops, door handles, furniture,
        and toys. Also clean your phone, laptop, and anything else you use
        regularly several times a day. Disinfect areas after you bring groceries
        or packages into your home. Use white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide
        solutions for general cleaning in between disinfecting surfaces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take social distancing seriously If you are carrying the SARS-CoV-2
        virus, it will be found in high amounts in your spit (sputum). This can
        happen even if you do not have symptoms. Social distancing means staying
        home and working remotely when possible. If you must go out for
        necessities, keep a distance of 6 feet from other people. You can
        transmit the virus by speaking to someone in close contact to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not gather in groups Being in a group or gathering makes it more
        likely that you will be in close contact with someone. This includes
        avoiding all religious places of worship, as you may have to sit or
        stand too close to another congregant. It also includes congregating at
        parks or beaches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid eating or drinking in public places Now is not the time to go out
        to eat. This means avoiding restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and other
        eateries. The virus can be transmitted through food, utensils, dishes,
        and cups. It may also be airborne from other people in the venue. You
        can still get delivery or takeaway food. Choose foods that are
        thoroughly cooked and can be reheated. High heat (at least 132°F/56°C,
        according to one recent, not-yet-peer-reviewed lab study) helps to kill
        coronaviruses. This means it may be best to avoid cold foods from
        restaurants and all food from buffets and open salad bars.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wash fresh groceries Soak all raw, whole fruits and vegetables in a
        solution of food-grade hydrogen peroxide or white vinegar. Let dry
        before putting them away in your fridge and cupboards. You can also use
        vegetable antibacterial wash to clean produce. Wash your hands before
        and after handling fresh produce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wear a (homemade) mask The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
        (CDC) recommendsTrusted Source that almost everyone wear a cloth face
        mask in public settings where social distancing may be difficult, such
        as grocery stores. When used correctly, these masks can help prevent
        people who are asymptomatic or undiagnosed from transmitting SARS-CoV-2
        when they breathe, talk, sneeze, or cough. This, in turn, slows the
        spread of the virus. The CDC’s website provides instructionsTrusted
        Source for making your own mask at home, using basic materials such as a
        T-shirt and scissors. Some pointers to keep in mind: Wearing a mask
        alone will not prevent you from getting a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Careful
        handwashing and social (physical) distancing must also be followed.
        Cloth masks aren’t as effective as other types of masks, such as
        surgical masks or N95 respirators. However, these other masks should be
        reserved for healthcare workers. Wash your hands before you put on your
        mask. Wash your mask after each use. You can transfer the virus from
        your hands to the mask. If you’re wearing a mask, avoid touching the
        front of it. You can also transfer the virus from the mask to your
        hands. Wash your hands if you touch the front of the mask. A mask
        shouldn’t be worn by a child under 2 years old, a person who has trouble
        breathing, or a person who can’t remove the mask on their own.
      </li>
      <li>
        Self-quarantine if sick Call your doctor if you have any symptoms. Stay
        home until you recover. Avoid sitting, sleeping, or eating with your
        loved ones even if you live in the same home. Wear a mask and wash your
        hands as much as possible. If you need urgent medical care, wear a mask
        and let them know you may have COVID-19.
